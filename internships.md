- Leading design and development of scalable web crawler, capable of crawling web pages with up to ~100K links and supports deduplication of embedded documents
- Implemented crawl component with AWS SQS URL frontier triggering AWS Lambda based recursive crawls while tracking crawl history in DynamoDB
- Developed decoupled AWS Lambda based downloader component to concurrently download crawled URLs into S3
- Projected to enhance domain generalization and increase downstream QA model performance across various domains

### Technical Undergraduate Intern
#### <span style="color:grey;">AppDynamics, Bangalore, India</span> <span style="float:right;">January - May 2021</span>

- Developed Component Tests for OpenTelemetry supported agent using JUnit

custom Java objects and is currently being used by the OpenTelemetry team to test future builds of agent 
- Collaborated closely with software development team to identify testing requirements and aided in resolving
bugs during development


### Research Intern
<h6><span style="color:grey;">Centre for Cloud Computing & Big Data, Bangalore, India</span><span style="float:right;">June 2019 - December 2020</span></h6>

- Examined DeathStarBench and TeaStore microservices to identify performance bottlenecks responsible for
reduced efficiency of microservices based applications 
- Monitored utilization of system resources and investigated performance sensitivity of operating system
parameters using Docker Stats, perf, mpStat and TShark 
- Formulated a placement algorithm to map containers of a microservice to cores of server hardware and devised
a mechanism that coalesces services on commonly called paths into a single container, achieving up to 26%
improvement in latency and 29.5% in throughput 
- Published 2 papers at JSSPP 2021 and CCEM 2020
