### Research Intern
#### <span style="color:grey;">Centre for Cloud Computing and Big Data, PES University</span>

- Examined DeathStarBench and TeaStore microservices to identify performance bottlenecks responsible for
reduced efficiency of microservices based applications 
- Monitored utilization of system resources and investigated performance sensitivity of operating system
parameters using Docker Stats, perf, mpStat and TShark 
- Formulated a placement algorithm to map containers of a microservice to cores of server hardware and devised
a mechanism that coalesces services on commonly called paths into a single container, achieving up to 26%
improvement in latency and 29.5% in throughput
