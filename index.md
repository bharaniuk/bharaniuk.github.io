[School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I am working as a Software Engineer at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) on the [Elastic Kubernetes Services](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) team. Prior to joining AWS, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Frontier's Market](https://frontiersmarket.com/).
