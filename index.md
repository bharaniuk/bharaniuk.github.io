I am a graduate student in the ! [Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)] (https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/) program at the 
Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University.
I am currently working as a Data Science Intern at Cognistx, Pittsburgh on their SQUARE product.
Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from PES University, India. 
During this time, I was a Research Intern at the Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data where I majorly worked on 
the characterizing the performance sensitivity of OS parameters in Microservice environments.

I am interested in leveraging the power of NLP, ML and Data Science in general to revolutionize business, science, 
and the quality of life, at large by tapping into the vast potential that data has to offer to change the world, one algorithm at a time.
