I am a December 2022 grad from the [Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} program at the 
[School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
During the Summer of 2022 I interned at [Cognistx](https://www.cognistx.com/){:target="_blank"} as a Data Scientist intern. Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), India.

I am actively seeking full time roles in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

I am passionate about leveraging the power of NLP, ML and Data Science in general, to tap into the vast potential of data in revolutionising businesses, science, and everyday lives, by building technologies that positively impact the world!
