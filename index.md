I am a graduate student in the [Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/) program at the 
[Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
I am currently working as a Data Science Intern at [Cognistx](https://www.cognistx.com/). 

Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), India. 
During this time, I was a Research Intern at the Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data where I majorly worked on 
the characterizing the performance sensitivity of OS parameters in Microservice environments.

My interests lie in leveraging the power of NLP, ML and Data Science to tap into the vast potential that large-scale data has to offer 
to revolutionize business, science, and the quality of life!.
