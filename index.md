title: Hi, I'm Bharani!
---
I am a graduate student in the [Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/) program at the 
[Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
I am currently interning at [Cognistx](https://www.cognistx.com/) as a Data Science intern. Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), India. 
During this time, I was a Research Intern at the Center for Cloud Computing and Big Data where I majorly worked on 
the characterizing the performance sensitivity of OS parameters in Microservice environments.

I will be graduating from CMU in December 2022, and I am actively looking for full time roles in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning 
and Software Engineering starting early 2023.

My interests lie in leveraging the power of NLP, ML and Data Science in general to tap into the vast potential that data has to offer 
to revolutionize business, science, and the quality of life! 
Working closely with others has instilled in me a zeal for teamwork and collaboration.
I am a curious problem solver who aims to build technologies that positively impacts the lives of people around the world!
