title: Hi, I'm Bharani!

I am a graduate student in the [Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS)](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/) program at the 
[School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
I am currently interning at [Cognistx](https://www.cognistx.com/) as a Data Science intern. Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), India. 

I will be graduating from CMU in December 2022, and am actively seeking full time roles in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

I am passionate about leveraging the power of NLP, ML and Data Science in general, to tap into the vast potential of data in revolutionising businesses, science, and everyday lives, by building technologies that positively impact the world!
